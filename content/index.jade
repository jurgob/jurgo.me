    h3 About Me
    p I'm a quite experienced javascript programer with a past as team leader.
    p In my current job I mainly work as a frontend developer, but I've worked also as backender (using javascript platforms).
    p Recently I'm interested in <a href="http://isomorphic.net/javascript" >isomorphic javascript</a> and I'm really exited about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" >Reactjs</a> framework and the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> approach.
    p I also love to create web ui, fallowing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement strategy</a> and using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript">Javascript unobstrusive approach</a>. Cross browser Approach was a must in my past work (I did websites who can be viewed from the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_curve_8310-2050.php">Blackbarry 8310</a> as from  the Iphone).
    p I spent my last 5 years mainly developing with javascript, but in my "past live" I did some experience with Java and Python.
